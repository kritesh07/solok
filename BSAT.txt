
########Basic Server Administator Tasks########

1.Top - command is used to show the Linux processes. It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system.

For examples: top 

	PID: Shows task’s unique process id.
	PR: Stands for priority of the task.
	SHR: Represents the amount of shared memory used by a task.
	VIRT: Total virtual memory used by the task.
	USER: User name of owner of task.
	%CPU: Represents the CPU usage.
	TIME+: CPU Time, the same as ‘TIME’, but reflecting more granularity through hundredths of a second.
	SHR: Represents the Shared Memory size (kb) used by a task.
	NI: Represents a Nice Value of task. A Negative nice value implies higher priority, and positive Nice value means lower priority.
	%MEM: Shows the Memory usage of task.
	

2.Netstat - command displays various network related information such as network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, 
            masquerade connections, multicast memberships etc
			
Examples of some practical netstat command

	# netstat -a | more : To show both listening and non-listening sockets.
	# netstat -at : To list all tcp ports.
	# netstat -au : To list all udp ports.
	# netstat -l : To list only the listening ports.
	# netstat -lt : To list only the listening tcp ports.
	# netstat -lu : To list only the listening udp ports.
	# netstat -lx : To list only the listening UNIX ports.
	# netstat -s : To list the statistics for all ports.
	# netstat -st(TCP/UDP) : To list the statistics for TCP/UDP ports.
	# netstat -pt : To display the PID and program names.
	# netstat -c : To print the netstat information continuously.
	# netstat --verbose : To get the non-supportive address families in the system
	# netstat -r : To get the kernel routing information.
	# netstat -ap | grep ssh : To get the port on which a program is running.
	# netstat -an | grep ':80' : To get the process which is using the given port.
	# netstat -i : To get the list of network interfaces.
	

3.Lsof - command stands for List Of Open File. This command provides a list of files that are opened. Basically, it gives the 
         information to find out the files which are opened by which process.
		
Options with Examples:
    # lsof -u username : List all files opened by a user.
    # lsof -u ^root : List all files which are opened by everyone except a specific user.
    # lsof -c Mysql : List all open files by a particular Process.
	# lsof -p process ID : List all open files that are opened by a particular process.
	# lsof -p ^process ID : Files opened by all other PID.
	# lsof -R : List parent process IDs.
	# lsof -D directory path (+D /home/kritesh) : Files opened by a directory.
	# lsof -i tcp :  Files opened by network connections.
	
		
4. Telnet - is a protocol that allows you to connect to remote computers (called hosts) over a TCP/IP network (such as the Internet).		 
	
	For Example: telnet hostname="" or=""
        Example:
                 telnet localhost
				 

5.Curl - is a command line tool to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3,
         SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). This tool is preferred for automation, since it is designed to work without 
		 user interaction. curl can transfer multiple file at once.

   	For Example:
    
    # -o : saves the downloaded file on the local machine with the name provided in the parameters.
      Syntax: curl -o [file_name] [URL...]
	  Example: curl -o hello.zip ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip.

    # -O : This option downloads the file and saves it with the same name as in the URL.
      Syntax: curl -O [URL...]
      Example: curl -O ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip

    # -C – : This option resumes download which has been stopped due to some reason. This is useful 
	         when downloading large files and was interrupted.	
      Syntax: curl -C - [URL...]
      Example: curl -C - -O ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip

    # -u : curl also provides options to download files from user authenticated FTP servers.
      Syntax: curl -u {username}:{password} [FTP_URL]
	  Example: curl -u demo:password -O ftp://test.rebex.net/readme.txt
	  
	# -T : This option helps to upload a file to the FTP server.
      Syntax: curl -u {username}:{password} -T {filename} {FTP_Location}

	# –libcurl : This option is very useful from a developers perspective. If this option is appended to any cURL command, it outputs 
	             the C source code that uses libcurl for the specified option. It is the code similar to the command line implementation.  

	  Syntax:  curl [URL...] --libcurl [filename]
      Example: curl https://www.geeksforgeeks.org > log.html --libcurl code.c
