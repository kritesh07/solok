
########How to Install and Configure Squid Proxy on CentOS 7##################


 A proxy server is a computer which sits between two endpoint devices and acts as an intermediate device. When the client computer 
 requests a resource from the server, it may be a file or a web page, the request is sent to the proxy server first.The proxy server 
 then sends the request to the destination server and obtains the resource sent by the server. Once the resource is obtained by the 
 proxy server, it sends the resource to the client machine. The use of a proxy server is that it can cache the resource, for example 
 if a website is accessed frequently from a proxy server, it's likely that the proxy server will have the content of the site in its 
 cache, it can now serve the webpage directly to the user. A proxy server can be used to facilitate security, administrative controls 
 and caching services. Proxy servers can also be used for anonymity as whenever obtaining a resource from a server, proxy server uses 
 its own IP address rather than the client's IP address.
